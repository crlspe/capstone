                            Once a candidate submits his/her application, the timeline is approximately 30 days to vet and interview. The membership process is as follows:
                            <p>
                                <br>- The candidate is invited to attend up to two (2) monthly meetings to get a feel for our organization before applying for membership;
                                <br>- The CEO Netweavers member who invited the potential candidate and a member of the membership Committee discuss the candidate’s membership criteria and interest in our organization;
                                <br>- If the CEON member (sponsor) recommends the candidate for membership, the sponsor or a member of the Membership Committee provides the candidate the membership application link to apply;
                                <br>- The candidate completes the application, which is then reviewed by the Membership Committee against our stated criteria.  If the candidate meets the criteria, then two interviews are set up with the candidate:  one with a member of the Membership Committee and one with a member of the Operating Committee;
                                <br>- The Executive Director and the membership Committee Chair review the interview results and follow-up with the candidate or sponsor if further clarification is needed;
                                <br>- The interview results are reviewed with the entire membership committee and a decision is made on whether or not to recommend the candidate for membership;
                                <br>- If the Membership Committee supports extending an invitation to join, the Chair of the Membership Committee recommends the candidate for membership at the next Operating Committee meeting;
                                <br>- If the candidate does not meet the criteria outlined for membership, the Membership Committee Chair will discuss with the CEO member (sponsor) and the decision is then communicated to the candidate.

                                Through a co-developed program with Kennesaw State University and Georgia Tech Universities, CEO Netweavers members volunteer as mentors to second year KSU and GT MBA Students. Among other things, the MBA mentoring program provides each student with a trusted advisor who provides a long-term career perspective on topics selected by the student. Students and Mentors are carefully matched and meet regularly throughout the school year.
                            </p>

                            All members have and are encouraged to participate in the KSU and/or GT mentor programs.

                            The goal is for guests to be potential members of our community.  As such it serves the community to invite guests that meet the criteria for membership.  Guests who are qualified to become members are allowed to come as a guest for a maximum of two meetings before being asked to join.  It is the responsibility of members not to invite the same guest more than two times.  On occasion members will invite non‐member guests to hear specific speakers.  This should be the exception.  Please let Pat Hurston know prior to inviting these guests.
