                    <p>
                        <br>- A philosophy and set of practices that enrich the lives of individuals, builds better organizations and ultimately creates a more just and caring world;
                        <br>- The emphasis is on the needs of others first;
                        <br>- Traits include empathy, listening stewardship, commitment to actively encouraging and serving others.

                    <p><b>Netweaving/Pay It Forward</b></p>
                    <p>
                        <br>- “Pay It Forward” is an approach that builds bridges of trust by listening and actively engaging in helping others with no expectation that doing so will result in a personal benefit. It is the proactive facilitation of sharing ideas, information, relationships and experiences to help others first;
                        <br>- Netweaving is a “Pay It Forward” activity and represents a specific set of skills which focus on connecting people and supplying them with resources which they or others in their trusted network are willing to provide;
                        <br>- Netweaving is a characteristic of a Servant Leader.

                    <p>
                        Trusted Relationships are built on mutual respect and based upon the authentic and accountable connections of individuals, personal integrity, confidentiality, candor and self-respect. In a professional setting the individuals in these trusted relationships:
                        <br>
                        <br>- Are expected to open their lives more fully to others;
                        <br>- Are willing to seek out each other’s company rather than to interact only because of practical convenience or necessity;
                        <br>- Become motivated by a sense that the benefits one partner offers are offered without expectation of receiving something in return;
                        <br>- Expect that the relationship itself generates a true sense of reward.
