# CEO Netweavers Website Re-Design

<p>This is our project website for the CEO Netweavers site redesign. We helped the CEO Netweavers non-profit organization redesign their Wordpress site and we added a bunch of functionality that they requested. This is obviously a very custom built project for a single organization, however, the information here may be relevant to anybody else looking to do customizations to an existing wordpress site.</p>

## Live Site
[Staging Site](https://ksu-teama.ceonetweavers.org/)

<p>On the above link you will find the live-staging site. CEO Netweavers was kind enough to provide us with an AWS instance for us to showcase our progress to them.</p>

<p>The site itself runs on a typical LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP). We are running wordpress version 5.8.1 and PHP version 7.2</p>

## Demo Presentation 

Below you will find our demo video, where you can see the site's redesign. We implemented all the design features our client requested and we believe we stayed true to their new vision. The organzation had evolved throughout the years and we feel this new design reflects their growth.
